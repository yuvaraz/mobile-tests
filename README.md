# Project Title
eBay Mobile automation task

## Getting Started
This project designed using Page Object Model with Page Factory (POM). All page objects are places in src/main/pages and testcases are place in src/test/testcases

### Why we used Page ObjectModel?

Page Object Model is a Design Pattern which has become popular in Selenium Test Automation. It is widely used design pattern in Selenium for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication. Page object model (POM) can be used in any kind of framework such as modular, data-driven, keyword driven, hybrid framework etc. The benefit is that if the UI changes for the page, the tests themselves donâ€™t need to change, only the code within the page object needs to change. Subsequently, all changes to support that new UI is located in one place.
